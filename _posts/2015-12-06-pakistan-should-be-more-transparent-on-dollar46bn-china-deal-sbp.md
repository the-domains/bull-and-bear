description: "KARACHI: Pakistan needs to be more transparent about the details of energy and infrastructure deals worth $46 billion signed with China earlier this year, the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan said on Friday. The deals, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), should help shore up Pakistan's crumbling infrastructure and reduce its electricity shortages by building more power plants."
