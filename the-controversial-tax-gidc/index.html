It has been highly controversial and its legality has been challenged in court by several companies mainly from the fertilizer industry that needs gas to product their product.
The cess was raised to Rs100 per million British thermal unit on January 1, of gas consumed, going directly into the pockets of the federal government, to develop the natural gas infrastructure in the country, including long overdue Iran-Pakistan pipeline, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India  pipeline and the LNG Terminal projects. The government has so far squeezed Rs131 billion out of the pockets of gas consumers including Fauji Fertilizer Company (#FFC), Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim (#FFBL), Fatima Fertilizer (#FATIMA), Engro Corporation (#ENGRO) and Engro Fertilizer (#EFERT) – also the big names in the KSE30 Index. </p><p><b>Marred by controversy </b></p><p>Ever since its imposition through enactment of the “Gas Infrastructure Development Cess Act, 2011” on December 15, 2015, The Peshawar High Court termed the GIDC Act as unconstitutional and directed the authorities to refund the amount that had been collected previously. In addition to this, Sindh High Court granted a stay against charging GIDC. 
In the final blow, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, on August 22, 2014, passed a judgment against an appeal, upholding Peshawar High Court’s order beside ordering refunds and adjustments of the amounts collected via the cess. 
The government still has options, however, to protect the cess from banishment. It can go through proper channels to incorporate the tax in the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority Act, where it will need to present  a bill in the Lower House (Parliament) and get due approvals from the Upper House (Senate). The government can also appeal in the Supreme Court, arguing to repeal the decision. 
What is the government’s next move remains to be seen… 
According to fiscal accounts, the government collected 4% of total revenue from GIDC – a major source of revenue.  The International Monetary Fund has linked the gas tax as one of the key implementations as part of Pakistan current loan programme. 
</p><p><b>What the future holds </b></p><p> Since the Supreme Court’s decision, publicly-listed companies such as D.G Khan Cement (#DGKC) and Maple Leaf Cement (#MLCF) have already accounted for reversals for the GIDC they paid over the last two years. However, the voices in the market believe in reenactment of the GIDC via an amendment in the Ogra Act and no refunds and adjustment made. 
All is not bad news though. Even if the matter does go in favour of the federation, the fertiliser stocks will remain positive as no reversals are made by the fertiliser sector yet.
